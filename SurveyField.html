    <p>According to a Steam-games analytic site "<a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/438100" target="_blank">SteamCharts</a>", I found out that an average number of people playing the game is about 6,400 per month and 6,600 per day. And the number is increasing every month. Even right now, while I am writing this text, there are 5,682 persons who are playing the VRChat.</p>
<img src="img/stat_ppl.jpg" width="600" height="700" class="img-fluid">
   <p>Unfortunately, I couldn't find any exact information about ages and genders playing this game. I have looked at these specific sites but got nothing according demographic groups of player.<br>
   <ol>
     <li>Game stat and chart on the Steam-site. It just shows a number of peak and current players of sever Steam-games by last 48 hours. Nothing about the "VRChat" and demographic.<br>
     <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/stats/" target="_blank">Statistic of the Steam.</a></li>
     <li>The same type information but on another website called "Steamcharts", and this time specifically about the "VRChat" - also about current and peak players. Also nothing about demorgaphic groups.
     <br> <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/438100" target="_blank">SteamCharts</a>.</li>
     <li>Last site on my mini-list is the pretty popular Steam-games based statistics site - <a href="https://steamspy.com/app/438100">SteamSpy</a>.
     <br>
     Although, it shows the stat about playtime, unfortunately, it does not show the other information for free. You need to pay fixed price to owner on the "Patreon".</li>
   </ol>
   <p>So, as you may see, although I have tried to look for the demographic information on several websites, none of them showed me statistics about gender and ages of the players.</p>
   <p>However, by my own observing while playing the "VRChat" game, I have got an opinion that there is a wide demographic range of people playing the game coming from various occupations.</p> 
   <p>Since the minimum required age for the playing is 13 years old, according to oficial rules on the website, I have met a decent amount of teenagers, of course. However, besides that, I've met a lot of young adults, and even some middle-aged persons. Sure, the number of YA much higher than middle-ages.</p>
   <p><i>As for nations and countries</i>, the game is very diverse. I have met a bunch of people from Europe (Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Ukraine, Finland, and etc.), Asia (Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Australia), and, of course, Americans and Canadians. On the other hand, there are not so many people from Africa (I've just met one) or any Arab country.</p> 
   <p><i>Professions</i>. Honestly, I did not ask anyone about their job, or any other occupation specifically. For sure, there are a lot of high-school student or college/universities ones. As I said, the youth much more than others.</p>
   <p><i>As for gender</i>, I did not see a big difference. The game community is divided by gender pretty equally. I believe you may find men and women on the same server.</p>
   <p>
    So, to conclude, here is a list of an approximate number of ages, and list of countries:
    
    <ol>
      <li>Overall ages may vary from 13 to 30-35 years old. The game is the most popular for people from 17 to 27 years old.</li>
      <li>Most "active" regions: Europe (including Russia) and USA/Canada. There are also Asians (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, etc), but the number is much less than others.</li>
      <li>Occupation: Considering p. 1, there are a lot of students. I do not have much information about professions. But I believe they are also really varied, considering how many people are playing the game (refer to the pic).</li>
      <li>There is no big difference in terms of gender in the game.</li>
    </ol>
